I am going to create an system monitor tool using the bash scripting language.

functions for my tool:

- Monitor the system usage ==> htop, top
- monitor the memory consumption
- disk space usage => df
- network traffic (in/out) => netstat

May be additional:

- log file generation
- email notification when specific criteria
